## Synopsis
The original goal of this project was to create a functional calendar app that would help students schedule goals for studying around their concrete schedules.
Unfortunately, due to design changes, I only have a functioning calendar app using the java console.

## Design
This projects uses a three tier Model View Controller design, with the controller layer using the Composite and Factory Method Pattern, which worked out great when working with directories and file storage.

## Class Diagram

## Usage
When you start the app, it will ask you for a username.  If you have previously used this app on your device, your saved schedule will be loaded.  Once loaded, the user can add Activities to their schedule and print view their schedule.
